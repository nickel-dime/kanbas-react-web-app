    This is a paragraph. We often separate a long set of sentences with vertical
    spaces to make the text easier to read. Browsers ignore vertical white
    spaces and render all the text as one single set of sentences. To force the
    browser to add vertical spacing, wrap the paragraphs you want to separate
    with the paragraph tag
